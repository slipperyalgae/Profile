            <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
            <p>Hi guys, my name is Rizal Nurul Fadjri and this is my own website. It's not perfect 
                <br>but I made it by myself and I couldn't done it without my man from India. His channel called
                <br> “Web Dev” and he got quite many subscribers.  All credits to him. Thanks mate. I am doing 
                <br>this because it's like my actual passion. I always wanted to have my own website so I 
                <br>can write down all the things in my mind. Currently I'm living with my parents in a city 
                <br>in Central Java. I was born in 2002, so I think it's time for me to start think about my 
                <br>life and ….yeah my life.  I don't know what I'm going to be in the future, but I hope I
                <br> can give all my knowledges to the communities and everyone around me. And I have a dream 
                <br>that someday when I have a lot of money (Amen), I  will spend it to those in need.
                <br> It sounds wiseful, but yeah I hope it happens.  Well, that's all. Apparently my words
                <br> couldn't fit in this slide. Thanks for your time to visit my humble website. Adios
            </p>
